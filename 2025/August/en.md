# August 2025

Dear readers,

We are currently working at full speed on the new DATEX Core. This highly technical process also impacts strategic topics, such as the question of a DATEX licensing model or
the design of the new human-readable variant, DATEX Script.

The diverse discussions on language design can be viewed at any time [on GitHub](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core/discussions).
Contributions are welcome!

# Association

**DATEX remains under the MIT license!**

At the last association meeting, it was discussed whether the new development of DATEX
should follow a correspondingly new licensing scheme. A risk is considered that
influential commercial players could exploit the work of the non-profit
unyt.org e.V. and make proprietary modifications without supporting the association's activities.

As the de facto standard, however, the MIT license is considered one of the most innovation-driving licenses
and is a basic requirement for many companies to try out and use tools
and thus promote their development. It is not in the spirit of unyt.org
to generally prevent companies from developing their own tools.

Since a copyleft license would be too invasive, after careful consideration, it was decided
to stick with a permissive MIT license and to accept any commercial appropriations in favor of
extensive freedom. A dual-licensing model could be considered for the future.
