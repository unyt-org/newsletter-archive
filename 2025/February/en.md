# February 2025

Dear readers,

since our last newsletter we've wrapped a successful semester of university education,
opened the [unyt.org Shop](https://shop.unyt.org) and reached first milestones with
our new flagship technology DATEX Core.

# Association

**Visit our unyt.org Shop.**

At [shop.unyt.org](https://shop.unyt.org), you will find a variety of stylish merchandise
products designed by our association members. Whether [you're thirsty](https://shop.unyt.org/product/unyt-mug),
want to show your [love for our favorite technologies](https://shop.unyt.org/product/unyt-sweater) or need to
[channel your feelings about Safari](https://shop.unyt.org/product/safari-homies), our new shop has got you covered.

Needless to say, it was written entirely in UIX and DATEX in just a few days of work and supports PayPal,
credit/debit cards and Apple Pay through our payment providers.

# Development
Apart from continuous maintenance bug fixes in UIX and DATEX, the new DATEX Core is under steady development
and shows first fundamental functionalities.

## [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:YYYY-MM-01..YYYY-MM-DD)
* Load time optimizations for hybrid rendering
* Minor bugfixes

## [DATEX](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:YYYY-MM-01..YYYY-MM-DD)
* We have already been able to send and receive the first DATEX blocks with our new DATEX Rust Core development. This progress is a huge step forward and provides us with deep insights into development with Rust and WebAssembly (WASM).
