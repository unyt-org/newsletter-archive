# May 2025

Dear readers,

We've made great progress and are delighted to announce the release of our all-new homepage at [unyt.org](https://unyt.org)!
Together with the ongoing development of our DATEX Rust Core we are taking great steps to elevate our association
to the professional level we've been aiming at. The future looks bright – thank you to everyone who contributed.

# Association

**The homepage rework is complete.** After nearly a year of planning and discussions, we've finally
implemented our new homepage. It's a fundamental redesign which focuses on structure, drastically
eliminates bulky text paragraphs and implements cleaner, standardized [unyt UI Components](https://github.com/unyt-org/unyt-components).

Alongside our core members, _Marvin_ has taken significant responsibility for unyt.org's redesigned web presence.
Our thanks go to him for taking a crucial role in our long-term efforts to present the association transparently
and approachable.

# Development
Work on DATEX routing mechanisms has been finished – next up is the DATEX language. UIX received minor improvements.

## [DATEX (Rust)](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:2025-05-01..2025-05-31)
* DATEX Protocol routing mechanism work for the Supranet has been finished
* We are working on the DATEX language including data serialization / deserialization (of DATEX Values) to allow for exchanging data via the DATEX Protocol
* The first version of the new DATEX language is already there. We can write first smaller scripts and try them out in our [REPL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read%E2%80%93eval%E2%80%93print_loop)

## [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:2025-05-01..2025-05-31)
* Dark/Light theme switching has been fixed
* Introduced `rawHTML` function support to inject plain HTML code into elements (similar to `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` in React)
* Other smaller bugfixes
