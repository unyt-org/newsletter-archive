# April 2025

Dear readers,

in April we started working on the new website and continued working intensively on our DATEX Core Rust.

We were delighted to welcome our two new team members, Marvin and Dave, to our association.
After the introductory phase, we are now moving on to developing a holistic concept and subsequently
implementing our new website.
