Dear readers,

in July, we ramped up our efforts in the development of DATEX Core Rust and 
reached some exciting milestones.

# Association

We would like to use this newsletter to advertise our open internship positions at unyt.org. 
We are currently looking for interns in the following areas:

* **Rust Development:** If you are interested in working on the DATEX Core Rust project, we would be happy to welcome you to our team.

Applications are possible at any time at: [https://unyt.org/career](https://unyt.org/career). We are looking forward to hearing from you!

# Development

We are thrilled to announce a major milestone in the development of DATEX Core Rust: 
On August 5, 2025, we transmitted the **first DATEX 2.0 block between two remote endpoints**! 
The block containing a simple Hello world message was successfully sent from an endpoint in Germany to an endpoint in Greece, demonstrating the capabilities of our new DATEX Core Rust implementation and serving as a first real-world test of our technology.

The latest release of DATEX Core Rust (v0.0.5) is now available on crates.io.
