# January 2025

**Happy new year**, dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,

in December, we took a break and had some time to recapitulate the
year 2024. Among some bug fixes and first steps with the new DATEX
Rust Core, we had a great German Tech Youtuber cover us.

# Association

Our General Assembly took place on January 07.
The protocol and its associated report
presentations can be found [here](https://github.com/unyt-org/administration-public/blob/main/Protocols/2025-01-07.md).

- **Congratulations, Benedikt Strehle**
  
  Benedikt Strehle is the new treasurer of the unyt.org e.V.
  He keeps an eye on the associations finances. As the financial
  report for 2024 indicated, we are almost able to finance our
  running costs solely by our membership fees. In 2025, we should
  reach the threshold where the association is self-sustaining
  exclusively through its membership fees.

  In December, German Tech [Youtuber Loris Galler](https://www.youtube.com/@lorisgaller) called us up to
  get some advice for a [new video](https://youtu.be/b7fJfbItzdM?si=RPvp_r3Qs3RZLkGH) he wanted to create
  about UIX and DATEX â€“ technologies which he named to be "game changers" for modern web development.
  His style is very diverting, studded with silly jokes and absurdly manages to be informative all
  the while. If you happen to understand the German language, a [subscription his channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lorisgaller?sub_confirmation=1)
  is a must.
