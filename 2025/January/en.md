# January 2025

**Happy new year**, dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,

in December, we took a break and had some time to recapitulate the
year 2024. Among some bug fixes and first steps with the new DATEX
Rust Core, we had the chance to get featured in a video from a great German Tech Youtuber.

# Association

Our General Assembly took place on January 7th.
The protocol and its associated report 
presentations can be found [here](https://github.com/unyt-org/administration-public/blob/main/Protocols/2025-01-07.md).

- **Congratulations, Benedikt Strehle**
  
  Benedikt Strehle is the new treasurer of the unyt.org e.V.
  He keeps an eye on the association's finances. As the financial
  report for 2024 indicated, we are almost able to cover our
  running costs solely with our membership fees. In 2025, we should
  reach the threshold where the association is self-sustaining
  exclusively through its membership fees.

- **Video by YouTuber Loris Galler**

  In December, German Tech [Youtuber Loris Galler](https://www.youtube.com/@lorisgaller) called us up to
  get some advice for a [new video](https://youtu.be/b7fJfbItzdM?si=RPvp_r3Qs3RZLkGH) he wanted to create
  about UIX and DATEX â€“ technologies which he named to be "game changers" for modern web development.
  His style is very diverting, studded with silly jokes and absurdly manages to be informative all
  the while. If you happen to understand the German language, a [subscription to his channel](https://www.youtube.com/@lorisgaller?sub_confirmation=1)
  is a must.

- **Recap Article for 2024**

  We published a new [article]() on our blog in which we talk in more detail about last year's achievements and also give a short outlook for 2025.
