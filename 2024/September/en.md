# September 2024

Dear readers,

the summer break has come to an end and significant progress was made with our developer experience improvement strategy.

# Association

**The new Developer Experience Initiative is rolling.** Now, we will eventually be able to provide our users with long sought-after
video tutorials. Members will produce diverting and informative content that new users can use as a starting guide. The [documentation](https://docs.unyt.org)
will be improved to reflect our recent technological redesigns *(see below)* to be more intuitive.

# Development
SUMMARY

## [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:2024-08-01..2024-08-31)
* We are currently on the verge of rolling out the new `UIX@0.3.x` version. For the first time, a custom [Deno for UIX build](https://github.com/unyt-org/deno) will replace the standard [Deno](https://deno.com) runtime and the integration of [JUSIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/jusix) will significantly improve the integrated reactivity for JSX, making it easier to use. The integration of **Deno for UIX** requires a far-reaching revision of our UIX documentation, new installation scripts and CI workflows and extensive changes to deployment services and our CDN. The official release date is expected to be mid-October and will be announced in advance on our official channels.
