# September 2024

Dear readers,

the summer break has come to an end and significant progress was made with our developer experience improvement strategy.

# Association

**The new Developer Experience Initiative is rolling.** Now, we will eventually be able to provide our users with long sought-after
video tutorials. Members will produce diverting and informative content that new users can use as a starting guide. The documentation
will be improved to reflect our recent technological redesigns (see below) and to be more intuitive.
