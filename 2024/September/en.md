# September 2024

Dear readers,

the summer break has come to an end and significant progress was made with our developer experience improvement strategy.

# Association

**The new Developer Experience Initiative is rolling.** Now, we will eventually be able to provide our users with long sought-after video tutorials. Members will produce diverting and informative content that new users can use as a starting guide. The [documentation](https://docs.unyt.org) will be improved to reflect our recent technological redesigns *(see below)* to be more intuitive.

# Development

## [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:2024-08-01..2024-08-31)
* We are currently on the verge of rolling out the new `UIX@0.3.x` version. For the first time, a custom [Deno for UIX build](https://github.com/unyt-org/deno) will replace the standard [Deno](https://deno.com) runtime and the integration of [JUSIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/jusix) will significantly improve the integrated reactivity for JSX, making it easier to use. The integration of **Deno for UIX** requires a far-reaching revision of our UIX documentation, new installation scripts and CI workflows and extensive changes to deployment services and our CDN. The official release date is expected to be mid-October and will be announced in advance on our official channels.


## [DATEX](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:2024-08-01..2024-08-31)
* DATEX is currently being migrated to be compatible with the Deno 2.0 version. Changes are currently ongoing, but will be completed soon. For further information, you can find the Deno migration guide [here](https://docs.deno.com/runtime/reference/migrate_deprecations/).

## Other
* The new installation scripts for Deno for UIX are available [here](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix-install)
* A new version management and download mirror for [Deno for UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/deno) can be found on [dl.unyt.org](https://dl.unyt.org)
* We've released version 2.0 for the [UIX Docker Hosts](https://github.com/unyt-org/docker-host)
