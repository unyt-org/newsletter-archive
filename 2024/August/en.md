# August 2024

Dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,

after some turbulent months the summer break gives us time to recover and focus on key points to achieve in 2024/Q3.

# Association

**The strategy for 2024/Q3 is set.**  
This time, it's all about developer experience and stability. With the development
of dedicated DATEX debugging tools and efforts towards the simplifaction of UIX
syntax, we hope to attract not just hobby developers but also professionals and
companies that rely on stable and predicatable systems with which they can
make fast progress.
