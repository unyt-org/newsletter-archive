# March 2024

Dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,
the last month's updates revolve around major compatibility and stability improvements for our frameworks and strategic decision making regarding the way we present ourselves in the public.

# Association
The main website will be overhauled. We will participate in social networks. 

- **The main website will be redesigned and overhauled.**
  After intensive discussions and inputs from various members, we have decided on a tone for our public communication. We intend to efficiently convey what unyt.org's objectives are and how we attempt to turn them into a reality through the provision of tools and platforms we develop. The focus on our main website shall therefore shift away from ideology and activism towards a more hands-on and fact-based approach. As the community we are, we would like to point out the open and welcoming nature of our projects throughout all of our sites.

- **We will participate in social networks. Help is welcome.**
  In order to make people aware of our projects, we will actively engage in certain digital media. Primarily, we will use LinkedIn to communicate topics regarding our association and the community (e.g. gatherings). Mastodon and Twitter will constitute the lesser formal mediums for interacting with the community of developers. We will thereby also react and comment on popular discussions where we think the unyt.org e.V. can contribute valuable perspectives to. If this sounds like a fun activity to you, we happily invite you to join our public relations working group.

# Development
UIX loading times were significantly improved. Compatibility with the latest Deno versions is ensured. Datex got a lot of code improvement refactoring and fixes.

With best regards
Your unyt.org team
