# December 2024

Dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,

as the last weeks of this year are passing, we are recapping the challenges and successes we have seen in 2024. After the extensive Developer Experience Initiative has led to numerous results in convenience and reliability, we are now shifting our focus towards a different, albeit related, area.



# Association

Our goals for Q1/2025 are set. Formal documents get a new home.

- **Agenda for Q1/2025**
  
  We have decided to use the year 2025 to develop an all-new low-level reference implementation for our
  flagship product "DATEX" â€“ a network protocol with realtime data synchronisation capabilities. It serves
  as the backbone of UIX and is now going to be formalized and stabilized with the emerging DATEX Rust Core.
  The UIX framework will also benefit from an increasingly stable implementation that does not only support
  JavaScript bindings but will also be usable on embedded devices. This means that you will then be able to
  connect IoT and Embedded Devices right to your PC or mobile software with just a few lines of code!


- **New Place for Formal Documents**

  To make our publicly accesible documents more approachable, we have transitioned from a custom Wiki system
  to document hosting in a public GitHub repository. This repository will also include issues and pull requests
  so that progress can be seen and tracked by everyone.

# Development
Mainly, the DATEX Rust Core development process has been prepared to begin in January 2025.
UIX and Datex Core JS Legacy will still receive stability and security improvements.
