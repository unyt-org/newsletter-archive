# May 2024

Dear readers,

the past month brought improvements to our project documentations, minor changes to DATEX and
ongoing efforts in our communication strategy.

# Association

The website is being overhauled. Video tutorials for UIX are in the making.

- **The website overhaul is in progress.**
  
  We intend to restructure the unyt.org website to communicate our objectives more concisely.
  This will also involve presenting the members of our team to make the association more
  approachable.


- **There will be an upcoming video tutorial series about UIX.**

  This series will be geared towards beginners to intermediates in the area of reactive web development.
  Showing the live development of exemplary projects, it will not only teach core concepts of the DATEX
  and UIX projects but it will furthermore focus on the real-world application of these technologies.
