# May 2024

Dear readers,

the past month brought improvements to our project documentations, minor changes to DATEX and UIX and
ongoing efforts in our communication strategy.

# Association

The website is being overhauled. Video tutorials for UIX are in the making.

- **The website overhaul is in progress.**
  
  We intend to restructure the unyt.org website to communicate our objectives more concisely.
  This will also involve presenting the members of our team to make the association more
  approachable.


- **There will be an upcoming video tutorial series about UIX.**

  This series will be geared towards beginners to intermediates in the area of reactive web development.
  Showing the live development of exemplary projects, it will not only teach core concepts of the DATEX
  and UIX projects but it will furthermore focus on the real-world application of these technologies.

- **We got active on social media.**

  We started to get more active on [X (Twitter)](https://twitter.com/unytorg) and [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/@unyt). Feel free to follow our channels!

# Development
Over the past month, we have been intensively working on improving and expanding our project documentation on [docs.unyt.org](https://docs.unyt.org). We were able to fix many bugs and thus improve overall stability of UIX and DATEX.

## [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:%3E=2024-04-01)
* Added documentation for observing [theme and mode changes](https://docs.unyt.org/manual/uix/style-and-themes#observing-theme-and-mode-changes)
* Fixed issue that prevented search engines from indexing sites (introduced with `UIX 0.2.1`)
* Ongoing work on utility functions for creating REST API endpoints with UIX *(part of next minor release)*
* Fixed issue with a third-party dependency in `UIX 0.2.4`

## [DATEX](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:%3E=2024-04-01)
* Major improvements in usage and and validation of [structs](https://docs.unyt.org/manual/datex/classes#datex-compatible-classes)

## Other
* [unyt.land](https://unyt.land) now supports module imports from the new [JSR registry](https://jsr.io). The unyt.land CDN allows you to use TypeScript modules from common sources such as deno.land or GitHub directly in the browser without a compile step.

# Upcoming Events
