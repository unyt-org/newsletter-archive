# April 2024

Dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,

March kept us busy with some organizational topics.

# Association

We applied for financial support. Our Discord Server has been restructured.

- **We applied for financial support through transformD.**
  
    After weeks of working out the details, we submitted our application for the [TransformD](https://www.deutsche-stiftung-engagement-und-ehrenamt.de/foerderung/transformd/) support program offered by the government-backed "Deutsche Stiftung f√ºr Engagement und Ehrenamt" organization. An accepted application would provide us with significant funds to expand and maturize our unyt Auth project. We expect feedback until end of June and keep you updated!


- **Our Discord Server has been restructured.**

    As our community continues to grow, we decided to restructure our Discord server. The support channel has been upgraded to a forum. Upcoming events, relevant channels and members can now be found right from the channel list.
