# April 2024

Dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,

March kept us busy with some organizational topics.

# Association

We applied for financial support. Our Discord Server has been restructured.

- **We applied for financial support through transformD.**
  
    After weeks of working out the details, we submitted our application for the [transformD](https://www.deutsche-stiftung-engagement-und-ehrenamt.de/foerderung/transformd/) support program offered by the government-backed "Deutsche Stiftung f√ºr Engagement und Ehrenamt" organization. An accepted application would provide us with significant funds to expand and maturize our unyt Auth project. We will keep you updated.


- **Our Discord Server has been restructured.**

    As our community continues to grow, we decided to restructure our server. The support channel has been upgraded to a forum. Upcoming events, relevabt channels and members can now be found right from the channel list.
