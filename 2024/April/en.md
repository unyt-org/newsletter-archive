# April 2024

Dear friends of the unyt.org e.V.,

March kept us busy with some organizational topics.

# Association

We applied for a funding program. Our Discord server was converted to a Community Server.

- **We applied for the transform_D funding program.**
  
    After weeks of working out the details, we submitted our application for the [transform_D](https://www.deutsche-stiftung-engagement-und-ehrenamt.de/foerderung/transformd/) support program offered by the government-backed "Deutsche Stiftung f√ºr Engagement und Ehrenamt" organization. An accepted application would provide us with significant funds to expand and maturize our unyt Auth project. We expect feedback until end of June and will keep you updated!


- **Our Discord Server has been restructured.**

    As our community continues to grow, we decided to convert our Discord server to a "Community Server", which allowed us to enable many new useful features.
  The support channel has been upgraded to a forum. Upcoming events, relevant channels and members can now be found right from the channel list.

# Development
We have refactored and enhanced our [example project collection](https://uix.unyt.org/templates). We also updated our [CDN](https://cdn.unyt.org) to improve loading times significantly.

## [UIX](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:%3E=2024-03-01)
* Improved [module dependency loading](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/issues/117) from unyt.org CDNs
* Eliminated [network errors](https://github.com/unyt-org/uix/issues/114) in the browser dev console
* Added reactivity to `UIX.Theme` properties to allow the handling of theme change and dark/light mode toggle
* Updated and extended our [documentation](https://docs.unyt.org) for UIX

## [DATEX](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy/pulls?q=is:closed%20created:%3E=2024-03-01)
* Added support for [MediaStreams via WebRTC](https://github.com/unyt-org/datex-core-js-legacy/pull/93)
* Major bugfixes and memory improvements

## Other
* Updated our public services ([relays](https://relay1.unyt.cc), [newsletter](https://newsletter.unyt.org), [blog](https://unyt.blog), [homepages](https://unyt.org), [unyt.land](https://unyt.land), [status](https://status.unyt.org) and [CDN](https://cdn.unyt.org)) to `UIX 0.2.x` and `DATEX 0.1.x`
